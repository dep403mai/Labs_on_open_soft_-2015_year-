# Labs_on_open_soft_-2015_year-
Лабораторные работы по курсу "Открытое программное обеспечение" для групп 4О-301Б и 4О-302Б. 2015 год, первый семестр.

Radiotech
This repository contains all the demo source code required to perform labs. 5 labs are planned.

List of labs:

Analog modulation (Amplitude modulation as an example)
Digital modulation (Amplitude shift keying (ASK) as an example)
Coding (Hamming code (7,4,3) as an example)
Something else
Requirements

To assume the correct work you have to download Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/) and Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/) libraries. Instructions are following:

Windows

If you're running Windows x32 you have to install following packages:

python-2.7.6 http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/
matplotlib-1.3.1.win32-py2.7 http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#matplotlib
numpy-1.8.0-win32-superpack-python2.7 http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy
pyparsing-2.0.1.win32-py2.7 http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyparsing
python-dateutil-2.2.win32-py2.7 http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#python-dateutil
scipy-0.13.3.win32-py2.7 http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy
six-1.5.2.win32-py2.7 http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#six
Other versions of these packages is avalible here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ (this site may be down sometimes)

Linux

If you're running Ubuntu/Debian you may install packages from repository:

sudo apt-get install python
sudo apt-get install python-numpy
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
OS X

In order to get the whole package of python libraries updates (e.g. numpy is in OS X as a base though getting newer version is a safe play for backward compatibility issues) you may consider reading this guide:

http://www.thisisthegreenroom.com/2011/installing-python-numpy-scipy-matplotlib-and-ipython-on-lion/

Even though it's quite outdated and based on OS X 10.7 Lion this guide is still reliable up to Mavericks. Ruby and XCode Command Line Tools must be obtained beforehand, look for the latter in Mac App Store; ruby is preinstalled and may be outdated too. We won't use any virtualization here so installing virtualenv isn`t necessary, also one may skip IPython.

Other

There are two branches. Master branch contains excersices, Test branch is additional (and also temprary non-existant for sake of laziness). There you can find additional functions, which won't be used in this course.

Pull request information

How to name the files: first_name_last_name_type_of_modulation.py

You have to add filename extension! (.py, .txt, etc)

You have to add source file into folder of your group
